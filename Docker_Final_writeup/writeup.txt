Tools used in this projects are:
1)Docker
2)AWS:EC2 instance
3)Visual studio code

 Deploying an Angular application on Docker container on an EC2 instance.

Steps that i have done are mentioned below:

1)First I have build the angular application by using the command ng build --prod.
2)Then after building it generates the dist file, we need to copy that files for furture use.
3)We need to create a docker file in our angular application.
4)Then build images using the command : docker build -t phpcode . -f Dockerfile
And also using the commands like,
=>docker images
=>docker run -d -p 80:80 --name container1 phpcode
=>docker ps
=>docker login
=>docker tag phpcode Shilpashree1498/docker_php
=>docker push Shilpashree1498/docker_php
5)We need to create the container also.After that i created the ec2 instance and I have copied the dist files to the virtual machine.
6)Using the ipv4 address I am able to access my angular application
=>IP Adress: 3.92.56.51
